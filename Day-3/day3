Day 3 – Cybersecurity 100-Day Challenge
Date: 2025-08-20

Topics Explored
TCP/IP Model vs. OSI Model

Wireshark Basics & Packet Analysis

What I Learned
TCP/IP Model:
Learned how the 4-layer TCP/IP model (Application, Transport, Internet, Link) maps to the OSI model and serves as the basis for real-world networking. Saw how protocols like HTTP, TCP/UDP, and IP work together to enable internet communication.

Wireshark Hands-On:
Captured live network traffic using Wireshark, filtered TCP/UDP/QUIC packets, and explored how packets are structured.
Observed:

TCP 3-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK)

TLS handshake (“Client Hello”)

QUIC traffic (modern web, used by Google)

Retransmissions and duplicate ACKs (how real networks handle loss)

Key Takeaways:

Packet analysis is essential for detecting suspicious activity, understanding normal behavior, and strengthening cybersecurity.

Tools like Wireshark make network traffic transparent—helpful for both defenders and attackers.

Realized that deep visibility into packets is the foundation for intrusion detection and forensic analysis.
