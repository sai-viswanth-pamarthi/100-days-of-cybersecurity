OSI Model (7 layers)

Networking Basics: MAC address, IP address, DNS

1. OSI Model – Summary and Observations
The OSI Model is a 7-layer conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system. Each layer has a specific role—together, they help computers communicate on a network.

The 7 Layers & Real-World Examples
Layer	Example Protocols	What It Does	Analogy
1. Physical	Ethernet, Wi-Fi	Physical cables/waves, sends bits	The wire/postman
2. Data Link	MAC Address, ARP	Node-to-node error detection, frames	Sender address
3. Network	IP, ICMP	Routing packets across networks	Destination city
4. Transport	TCP, UDP	Reliable delivery, ports	Delivery trucks
5. Session	NetBIOS, RPC	Session management between apps	Ongoing call
6. Presentation	SSL, TLS	Data formatting, encryption, translation	Translation
7. Application	HTTP, DNS, SMTP	User-interacting protocols, web/email	The message itself
Key Point: When you load a website, your request travels “down” these layers (on your PC) and “up” the stack (on the server).

2. Key Networking Concepts
MAC Address
A hardware identifier unique to each network interface (like your computer’s network card).

Used on the local network for device identification (Layer 2).

IP Address
A logical address assigned to each device on a network.

Used for routing packets across different networks (Layer 3).

DNS (Domain Name System)
Converts human-friendly domain names (like google.com) to IP addresses (like 142.250.68.14).

Vital for usability and security because attacks like DNS poisoning can redirect traffic.

3. Hands-on Practice (Commands & Output)
Commands Used:

bash
ifconfig          # Shows network interfaces, MAC/IP addresses
nslookup google.com   # Finds the IP(s) for google.com
