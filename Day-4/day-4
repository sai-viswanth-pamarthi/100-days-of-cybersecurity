Day 4 – Cybersecurity 100-Day Challenge
Date: 2025-08-20

Topics Covered
Advanced Wireshark Filtering Techniques

Attack Pattern Recognition: ARP Spoofing, SYN Floods, and Port Scans

Using Nmap to Simulate Reconnaissance Attacks

Practical Capture and Analysis of Network Scans and Attacks

What I Did
Explored and applied advanced display filters in Wireshark to isolate specific protocols and identify suspicious network activity.

Captured network traffic while browsing and during simulated Nmap scans in a controlled lab environment.

Detected and analyzed attack signatures such as ARP spoofing attempts and SYN scan patterns.

Documented findings through screenshots and detailed explanations of each attack pattern’s significance and detection method.

Key Learnings
Gained skills in using Wireshark filters to focus on relevant network traffic for security analysis.

Learned how common reconnaissance and network attacks manifest in packet data.

Understood how offensive tools like Nmap create identifiable patterns useful for defensive monitoring.

Strengthened ability to document and communicate security findings clearly with evidence.
