Day 1 – Cybersecurity 100-Day Challenge
Date: 2025-08-17


Personal Note:
This is Sai. I’m feeling confident as I start the cybersecurity 100-day challenge!

Concepts Explored
CIA Triad
Security Models

What I Learned
CIA Triad:

Confidentiality: Protects sensitive data so that only authorized users can access it.

Implementation: Encryption, access control, 2-factor authentication.

Examples: Hospital patient records, user personal data.

Integrity: Keeps data accurate and unchanged throughout its lifecycle.

Implementation: Hashing, digital signatures, certificates.

Availability: Ensures systems and data are accessible even during minor faults.

Implementation: Redundancy, fault tolerance, patching.

Takeaway: Every system that communicates must uphold the CIA triad to maintain security and usability.

Security Models:
A security model is a formal framework that defines the rules, policies, and procedures for protecting confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) within a system.

Bell-LaPadula Model:

Focuses on confidentiality (multi-level security, e.g., military hierarchies).

Rules:

Simple Security Property: No read up (can’t read higher classification).

Star ( ) Property:* No write down (can’t leak to lower classification).

Biba Model:

Focuses on integrity (protects data from unauthorized modification).

Rules:

Simple Integrity Property: No read down (can’t read lower integrity).

Star ( ) Integrity Property:* No write up (can’t contaminate higher integrity).

Clark-Wilson Model:

Also aims at integrity, separating constrained and unconstrained data items.

Important for systems where certain sensitive data must only be modified through proper, controlled procedures (e.g., banking transactions).

Networking Concepts Previewed:
OSI Model, MAC addresses, IPs, DNS – the fundamental building blocks of network security.

Reflection:

Starting strong and feeling motivated. Today I see how foundational these concepts are for building trustworthy systems, from hospitals to military, and how they are implemented in real-world controls.
